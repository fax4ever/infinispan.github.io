== Lithops Hot Rod storage backend

We are very happy to announce a Hot Rod storage backend for https://lithops-cloud.github.io/[Lithops], an open source framework for big data analytics 
and embarrassingly parallel jobs, that provides an universal API for building parallel applications in the cloud. 
The work was done in the context of the https://cloudbutton.eu[CloudButton] project, which aims to build a serverless platform for quickly deploying
workloads to the cloud, but the advantages are available to everyone using Infinispan!

=== Background

Lithops is a Python multi-cloud distributed computing framework. It allows you to run unmodified local python code at massive scale in the main serverless 
computing platforms. Lithops delivers the userâ€™s code into the cloud without requiring knowledge of how it is deployed and run. Moreover, its 
multicloud-agnostic architecture ensures portability across cloud providers.

Lithops has multiple storage backends and, up until now, it was able to access an Infinispan Server via its REST API.
While the REST API is functional, it doesn't offer all of the advantages that Hot Rod, our native protocol, provides, such as topology awareness and
client-side intelligence to automatically locate the owner of an entry, thus avoiding extra network hops.

=== The new Hot Rod Python client

We used to have a Hot Rod Python client that lied in semi-abandoned state for a long time. We decided it was time to get back on track. 
The https://github.com/infinispan/python-client[Hot Rod Python client] repository has been completely overhauled with our brand new implementation, which 
supports modern Infinispan features such as authentication, cache creation, etc.
This is now installable using PIP, the Python Package Installer. The following is a short example that shows how to connect to a secure Infinispan server and manipulate an entry:

.Example.py
[source,python]
----
from Infinispan import Infinispan
conf=Infinispan.Configuration()
conf.addServer("localhost",11222)
conf.setProtocol("2.4")
conf.setSasl("PLAIN", "node0", "writer", "somePassword")
manager=Infinispan.RemoteCacheManager(conf)
manager.start()
key=Infinispan.UCharVector()
key.push_back(56)
value=Infinispan.UCharVector()
value.push_back(8)
cache=Infinispan.RemoteCache(manager)
cache.put(key,value)
res=cache.get(key)
print (res.pop())
manager.stop()

=== The Lithops backend


Enabling the Lithops Hot Rod storage backend is very simple, as demonstrated by the code snippet below:

.LithopsStorageHotRod.py
[source,python]
----
from lithops import Storage

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st = Storage(backend='infinispan_hotrod')
    st.put_object(bucket='mybucket',
                  key='test.txt',
                  body='Hello World')

    print(st.get_object(bucket='mybucket',
                        key='test.txt'))
